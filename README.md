## üìö **Reasoning Segmentation with Improved OOD Handling in Vision-Language Models**

### üåü **Overview**  
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable advancements in understanding and processing the relationships between images and text. Modern VLMs go beyond simply connecting two modalities‚Äîlanguage and vision‚Äîto solve complex tasks that were traditionally confined to either vision or language domains.

A representative example is the **LISA model**, which outputs both **segmentation masks** and **textual answers** in response to image-related questions. While LISA serves as the foundation for many segmentation-capable VLMs, it encounters limitations in handling **Out-of-Distribution (OOD)** scenarios, such as when questions involve objects that do not exist in the given image.

This project addresses these limitations by providing **code for constructing a new OOD dataset** and applying minimal additional training. As a result, our approach significantly enhances **VQA (Visual Question Answering) accuracy** while maintaining minimal performance degradation in **reasoning segmentation** tasks. These outcomes strengthen the potential of VLMs as reliable multimodal models, paving the way for more trustworthy applications across various domains.

### üìä **Evaluation on OOD Dataset**  
The evaluation on the OOD dataset was conducted using **BERT Score** and **BLEU Score** metrics. Compared to the base **LISA-7B** model, our approach shows significantly higher performance. The results demonstrate that the dataset generation code provided in this project allows models to learn the relationship between text and images more effectively, enabling accurate textual generation even in OOD scenarios.

#### **BERT Score & BLEU Score Results**
| Model   | Precision | Recall | F1   | BLEU4 |
|---------|------------|---------|------|--------|
| LISA-7B | 90.78      | 92.58   | 91.65| 23.19  |
| **Ours**| **96.82**  | **96.85**| **96.83**| **65.17** |

Our model outperformed the baseline by achieving:
- **BERT Score:** Precision, Recall, and F1 scores of 96.82%, 96.85%, and 96.83%, respectively, which is an improvement of approximately 6.04%, 4.27%, and 5.18% over LISA-7B.
- **BLEU4 Score:** An increase from 23.19% to 65.17%, nearly tripling the score, highlighting significant improvements in text generation quality.

These results suggest that our model generates more appropriate responses to OOD questions by learning relevant contextual information during the dataset generation and training process.

### üß™ **IoU Evaluation for Reasoning Segmentation**
The **IoU (Intersection over Union)** performance was evaluated using the **ReasonSeg** dataset. While there was a slight performance drop due to OOD handling, our model still significantly outperformed other baseline models such as OVSeg and GRES.

#### **IoU Evaluation Results**
| Model   | gloU  | cloU  |
|---------|-------|-------|
| **Ours**| 36.77 | 42.07 |
| LISA-7B | 46.05 | 50.88 |
| OVSeg   | 26.1  | 20.8  |
| GRES    | 23.1  | 22.0  |

Key observations:
- Although our model shows a slight decrease compared to LISA-7B (due to the trade-off in focusing on OOD handling), it still significantly outperforms OVSeg and GRES.
- The results indicate that some segmentation capability might have been compromised while improving OOD performance, but the overall segmentation ability remains strong.
